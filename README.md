# Besser Pinned Tabs for Firefox

**Protects pinned tabs against unintentional closures and prevents opening a different website inside a pinned tab.**

Chrome and Firefox features

-   If you type a new address in a pinned tab's address bar, opens it as a new tab to preserve your pinned page

Firefox only features (to be added in Chrome)

-   When you click ANY link in a pinned tab, opens it in a new tab instead of replacing your pinned page.
    (Except for same-URL links, to prevent a tab being duplicated when refreshing a page)

Chrome-only features (Firefox already handles this behaviour natively)
<https://github.com/RetroYogi/Besser-Pinned-Tabs-Chrome>

-   Automatically reopens pinned tabs if they're accidentally closed, whether using keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks.
-   When you click a link to a different website in a pinned tab, opens it in a new tab instead of replacing your pinned page.
